          Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define
          paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five
          sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.<mark>
            In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences
            is what constitutes a paragraph.
